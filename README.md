# NextTrain
iOS app that shows real-time information about subway train arrivals in Seoul, South Korea.
The app was implemented using clean code and TDD principles. It has no external dependencies so it should just run by opening the project file.

## Requirements
* XCode 13
* Swift 5.5
* Rename `Secrets.example.plist` to `Secrets.plist`
    * If you don't provide an API key the app will still work within the api limits. For full access you must ask for an API key here: https://data.seoul.go.kr/
